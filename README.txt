### Summary of Client and Server Utility

#### Purpose:
This utility is designed to distribute and execute commands across multiple clients from a central server. It allows for remote command execution on multiple machines, making it ideal for tasks such as network management, system administration, or any scenario where commands need to be run simultaneously on several remote systems.

#### Software Components:
1. **Node.js Server**:
   - **Node.js** is used to create the server-side component, which manages connections from multiple clients, sends commands, and receives outputs from the clients.
   - **Readline** module in Node.js provides a command-line interface to interact with the server.
   - **Net** module in Node.js handles TCP connections, allowing the server to communicate with clients over the network.

2. **Python Client**:
   - **Python** is used for the client-side component, which connects to the server, receives commands, executes them locally, and sends the output back to the server.
   - **Socket** module in Python is used to establish a TCP connection to the server.
   - **Subprocess** module in Python allows the client to execute shell commands and capture their output.

#### How It Works:
- **Server**:
  - The server listens on a specified port for incoming connections from clients.
  - Each connected client is identified by its IP address and port.
  - The server provides a command-line interface (CLI) where the user can:
    - **List** all connected clients.
    - **Send** commands to a specific client or broadcast commands to all connected clients.
    - **Show** the output of commands executed by a specific client.
  - The server logs the outputs received from clients, allowing the user to review them at any time.

- **Client**:
  - The client connects to the server and waits for commands.
  - When a command is received, the client executes it locally and sends the output back to the server.
  - The client can handle simple shell commands, and in the event of a long-running command (like `netstat`), the client is designed to terminate the process if it exceeds a specified timeout, preventing hangs.

#### Use Case:
This utility is useful for distributing and managing commands across multiple machines in a network. For example, a system administrator could use this tool to:
- Run diagnostic commands on all computers in a network simultaneously.
- Execute maintenance scripts across multiple servers.
- Collect outputs and logs from various systems for centralized analysis.

Overall, this utility provides a simple yet powerful way to remotely manage and execute commands across multiple machines from a single interface.
